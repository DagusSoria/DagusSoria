- 👋 Hi, I’m @DagusSoria, my name is Daniel Agustín Soria, I'm from Córdoba, Argentina. 22 years old 👀.
- 🎮 I like videogames, 🎵 listen to music and 📚learn everything that seems minimally interesting to me!.
- 💼 I'm currently working at @Omni(https://omni.cr) as a backend developer (with Node, Express, Typescript, Fastify and AWS Lambda mainly) in the fintech branch.
- 👀 I’m a "game designer student" at university @IES21 (https://www.ies21.edu.ar). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine, Blender && English. And making some little experiments on them (They will be released in due course 🎁)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, no matter what position, role or pay, to adquire some quality experience in this industry.
- 📫 You can reach me sending me a DM on my linkedin, in english or español. 😅 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/agustin-soria-13b060156/) it's a bit unactualized 👀.
